Authorized access to the Site is permitted only by a Supplier’s employees (i) who are authorized by Supplier to access and use the Site under the rights granted pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) who have been granted by either Nordstrom or Supplier valid login credentials ("**Credentials**") to access the Site (each authorized user, a “**User**”). Every User must have a unique and valid email address in order to register as a User on the Site.

You may also permit other Users of your Supplier Account to access the Supplier Account as administrators. In doing so, you are liable for any unauthorized access to your Supplier Account. In the event that you are no longer an administrator for your Supplier Account, you will be responsible to delegate and authorize another User as an administrator for your Supplier Account with Nordstrom.

### Web Reporting Service Fee/Payment Terms  

Supplier sales and inventory web reporting is available on a subscription basis (“**Supplier Sales and Inventory Web Reporting Service**”). Access to the Supplier Sales and Inventory Web Reporting Service is subject to payment of all subscription fees established pursuant to this Agreement (“**Subscription Fees**”). All Subscription Fees will be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement without offset or deduction.

The annual Subscription Fee for each Supplier to access the Supplier Sales and Inventory Web Reporting Service is $100.00 USD per year beginning on January 1 and ending the following December 31 ("**Calendar Year**"). Subscription Fees will be due on the earlier of (i) the 1st week in January of the then current Calendar Year that the Supplier is given access to the Supplier Sales and Inventory Web Reporting Service, or (ii) ninety (90) days after a new Supplier is first set up as a Supplier in Nordstrom's accounting system and given access to the Supplier Sales and Inventory Web Reporting Service. If a Supplier becomes inactive or if the Supplier's access to the Supplier Sales and Inventory Web Reporting Service is terminated for any other reason and access to the Supplier Sales and Inventory Web Reporting Service is subsequently reactivated, Subscription Fees with respect to that Supplier will be due immediately upon reactivation of the Supplier's access.  

The Supplier Sales and Inventory Web Reporting Service reports sales and inventory information separately for each Supplier as established in Nordstrom's inventory and accounting system and organized by a unique supplier number and identification name. If Nordstrom does not purchase merchandise from a Supplier during a Calendar Year, the Supplier will become inactive, and will not be subject to a Subscription Fee during the following Calendar Year until Nordstrom orders merchandise from the Supplier. A "**Pay-To-Vendor**" is the parent company or entity responsible for the performance of a Supplier and to whom Nordstrom pays charges for merchandise ordered from a Supplier as established in Nordstrom's accounting system.  

Subscription Fees will be reflected by Nordstrom as a debit to the account of the Pay-To-Vendor for each Supplier for which a Pay-To-Vendor is responsible and will be deducted from the next payment processed by Nordstrom to the Pay-To-Vendor after the Subscription Fees are posted to the Pay-To-Vendor's account.  

All Subscription Fees and other amounts payable under this Agreement are exclusive of taxes and similar assessments. You or the entity that you represent are responsible for all sales, use, and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties, and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental or regulatory authority on any amounts payable by you hereunder, other than any taxes imposed on Nordstrom’s income.  

Nordstrom reserves the right to change the amount of and basis for determining Subscription Fees or to institute new fees or charges with respect access to the Supplier Sales and Inventory Web Reporting Service by revising these terms and conditions, which changes will apply to Supplier upon renewal of Supplier’s subscription.

NO CLAIM, ACTION OR DEMAND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE BROUGHT BY YOU MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION HAS ACCRUED.

### Applicable Law and Venue  
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, USA, without resort to its conflict of law provisions.

All claims relating to your access and use of the Site, including all disputes arising out of, or related to, this Agreement, will be resolved entirely through binding individual arbitration, rather than in court. You may also assert individual claims in small claims court if your claims otherwise qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. 

Note: There is no judge or jury in arbitration, no class actions, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages, and must follow this Agreement as a court would.  

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you may send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent: Nordstrom, Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 1700 7th Avenue, Suite 1000, Seattle, WA 98101. You agree that the arbitration will be conducted by either the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), adr.org, 1.800.778.7879, or the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"), jamsadr.com, 1.800.352.5267. You can contact AAA or JAMS to find out more information on how to commence an arbitration proceeding. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's or JAMS' applicable rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000. Likewise, Nordstrom will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  

We each agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class, consolidated, representative or collective action basis. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial or to participate in a class action against the other. In addition, we both agree that we each may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.  

THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA OR JAMS RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR NORDSTROM WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.  

### Notice.  
We may provide any notice to you under this Agreement by either posting a notice on the Site or sending a message to the email address then associated with your account. Such notice will be deemed given immediately upon posting or sending. To give us notice under this Agreement, you must contact us by personal delivery, or by certified mail return receipt requested, or by courier service that provides verification of receipt at the following address: Nordstrom, Inc., Attn.: Corporate Secretary, 1700 Seventh Avenue, Suite 1000, Seattle, WA 98101-4407. 

### Assignment.
You may not assign any of your rights or delegate any of your obligations hereunder, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this section will be null and void. No assignment or delegation will relieve you of any of your obligations hereunder. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.  

### Force Majeure.
In no event will either party be liable to the other, or be deemed to have breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement (except for any obligations to make payments), if and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond such party’s reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, or passage of law or any action taken by a governmental or public authority, including imposing an embargo.  

### Severability.  
If any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and conditions and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  

### No Waiver.
No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any rights, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege.
